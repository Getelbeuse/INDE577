## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of deep learning. These systems are inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains, simulating the way that biological neurons signal to one another.

At its core, a neural network is composed of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons," each capable of performing simple calculations. When these neurons are linked together in layers and activated by a function, they can transmit signals from input data and gradually learn to model complex patterns and behaviors.

### Structure of a Neural Network

- **Input Layer**: This layer receives raw input data analogous to sensory input in biological systems.
- **Hidden Layers**: One or more layers where computations are performed. These layers transform the input into something that the output layer can use.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer that produces the prediction or classification based on the inputs processed through the network.

### Learning Process

Neural networks learn through a process called training, where they adjust their internal parameters (weights and biases) based on the difference between their output and the expected result. The most common training method involves:
- **Forward Propagation**: Where inputs are passed through the network and output predictions are made.
- **Backpropagation**: A technique used to update the weights of the network based on the error rate obtained in the output compared to the expected results.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost (error) by iteratively moving towards the steepest descent.

### Applications

Neural networks are versatile and can be applied in numerous fields including:
- **Image and Speech Recognition**: They can learn to recognize patterns and specific features from vast amounts of data.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Assisting in predicting disease based on symptoms and past data.
- **Financial Services**: Used for predicting stock prices, assessing loan applications, and detecting fraudulent activities.
