## Introduction to Clustering Techniques: K-Means and DBSCAN

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning used in machine learning to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Two of the most popular clustering algorithms are K-Means Clustering and DBSCAN.

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means is a centroid-based algorithm, where the goal is to minimize the distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid. It is best used when you have a good estimate of the number of clusters your data should be divided into.

**How it Works:**
1. **Initialization**: Choose `K` initial centroids (where `K` is the desired number of clusters).
2. **Assignment**: Assign each point to the nearest centroid.
3. **Update**: Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all points assigned to that cluster.
4. **Iterate**: Repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence (i.e., the assignments no longer change).

**Applications**: K-Means is widely used in market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation, and image compression.

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density. It is particularly useful for data with clusters of varying shapes and sizes.

**How it Works:**
1. **Core Points**: In a given radius `ε`, if a point has more than `MinPts` (minimum points) within its neighborhood, it’s classified as a core point.
2. **Border Points**: Points that aren’t core points but are close to a core point.
3. **Noise**: Points that are neither core nor border points.
4. **Expansion**: All points within `ε` of a core point belong to the same cluster. This process continues until no new points can be added to any cluster.

**Applications**: DBSCAN is useful for spatial data analysis, anomaly detection, and working with data that contains clusters of similar density.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**K-Means:**
- **Advantages**: Simple to understand and implement; computationally efficient.
- **Disadvantages**: Assumes spherical clusters and is sensitive to outliers and the initial choice of centroids.

**DBSCAN:**
- **Advantages**: Does not require specifying the number of clusters; can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and robust to outliers.
- **Disadvantages**: Can be sensitive to the parameters `ε` and `MinPts` and may not perform well when the density varies significantly across the dataset.
